## 🌍 Project Overview
As Lead Engineer, I designed and deployed a **secure, segmented SD-WAN architecture** for **ICBT Campus** to connect multiple education centers to the headquarters.  

The solution leveraged **SonicWall firewalls** at each site to deliver **encrypted site-to-site connectivity, application-aware routing, and network segmentation**, ensuring security, scalability, and centralized visibility across all campuses.  

---

## 🎯 Business Challenges
- Fragmented networks with no unified security framework.  
- Limited visibility into inter-campus traffic flows.  
- Inconsistent security policies across branches.  
- Growing demand for **scalable connectivity** between HQ and campuses.  
- Need for **segmentation** of admin, academic, and student networks.  

---

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented
A **SonicWall SD-WAN–based design** was implemented to unify and secure connectivity:  
- **SonicWall firewalls** deployed at HQ and branch sites.  
- **SD-WAN overlay** for intelligent path selection and failover.  
- **Site-to-Site VPN tunnels** with encryption for inter-branch traffic.  
- **Network segmentation** (staff, students, guests, admin) via VLANs and policies.  
- **Centralized monitoring and intrusion prevention** using SonicWall security services.

## 📊 Outcomes & Benefits
- 🔒 **Secure and encrypted SD-WAN** linking HQ and campuses.  
- 🌐 **Standardized security policies** across all education centers.  
- 📈 **Application-aware routing** optimized WAN performance.  
- 🛡️ **Segmentation of student, staff, and admin traffic**.  
- ⚡ **Resilient connectivity** with seamless failover and performance monitoring.  
- 🕵️ **Improved visibility** into threats and inter-campus traffic.
